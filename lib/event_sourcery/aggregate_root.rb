module EventSourcery
  #
  # EventSourcery::AggregateRoot provides a foundation for writing your own aggregate root classes.
  # You can use it by including it in your classes, as show in the example code.
  #
  # Excerpt from {https://github.com/envato/event_sourcery/blob/master/docs/core-concepts.md EventSourcery Core Concepts} on Aggregates follows:
  # === Aggregates and Command Handling
  #
  #   An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.
  #   Every transaction is scoped to a single aggregate. An aggregate will have one of its component objects be
  #   the aggregate root. Any references from outside the aggregate should only go to the aggregate root.
  #   The root can thus ensure the integrity of the aggregate as a whole.
  #
  #   â€” DDD Aggregate
  #
  # Clients execute domain transactions against the system by issuing commands against aggregate roots.
  # The result of these commands is new events being saved to the event store.
  # A typical EventSourcery application will have one or more aggregate roots with multiple commands.
  #
  # The following partial example is taken from the EventSourceryTodoApp.
  # Refer a more complete example {https://github.com/envato/event_sourcery_todo_app/blob/master/app/aggregates/todo.rb here}.
  #
  # @example
  #   module EventSourceryTodoApp
  #     module Aggregates
  #       class Todo
  #         include EventSourcery::AggregateRoot
  #
  #         # An event handler that updates the aggregate's state from a event
  #         apply TodoAdded do |event|
  #           @added = true
  #         end
  #
  #         # Method on the aggregate that processes a command and emits an event as a result
  #         def add(payload)
  #           raise UnprocessableEntity, "Todo #{id.inspect} already exists" if added
  #
  #           apply_event(TodoAdded,
  #                       aggregate_id: id,
  #                       body: payload,
  #           )
